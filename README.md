### <u>Introduction</u>

Form app is an app that works with forms and fields.</br>
There are CRUD operations for both form and fields entities. </br>
Authorization with authentication. JWT token used.


### <u>Things I would do differently second time</u>

For my second time around, I would add Role table to database to reduce redundant fields. Also, I would add my </br>
custom annotation for roles and checking for authorities.
Also, I would implement search and sorting for application. </br>
I would add some more JUnit test with integration tests as well.
